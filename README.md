# web-1-project
Website made to showcase digital artworks.

This was a rinky-dink little project that was designed to test knowledge of basic html, css, and a drop of js. I intend to build this back
out with bootstrap and jQuery to host at a later date on GitHub pages. I also need to update my work as I'm moving away from digital painting and more into vector graphics for web and graphic design applications.

Once I get a small stock of images together I can build a new one. Maybe something to do in free time this summer.
