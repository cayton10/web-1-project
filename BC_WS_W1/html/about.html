            <div class="info-copy">
                <p>I was always interested in drawing when I was a kid. The only 'AP' courses I had taken
                    throughout highschool were for art classes, actually. I had a brief stint as an art major
                    when I first came to Marshall. Funny to think I'm back here again and still am not studying
                    art. Maybe that's where I'm messing up.
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway! I took a roughly 10 year hiatus from doing any kind of artistic work while I 
                    navigated my way through a geology degree. Rewind to about two years ago, and I was in 
                    a miserable job that did not give me any sense of satisfaction. I decided I need to
                    visit an old friend and look for a constructive outlet.

                    <p>If you've got 15 minutes and nothing better to do, you can check out the extended Timelapse
                        of the Thor painting I did above. I would really like to start doing live draws using
                        an iPad Pro and Procreate. There's built-in functionality to stream directly from the app,
                        which is pretty rad. 
                        <br><br>
                        Maybe I'll get around to doing some more painting soon. I'll probably get after it pretty hard 
                        on winter break, but after that, virtually all of my time is spent trying to get better at coding.
                        This semester, and specifically building this project has made me realize that I've got a long
                        way to go, especially if this is what I'm supposed to be doing for money after Spring '21.
                        <br><br>
                        In the interim, feel free to check out the blog link. It just takes you to my Wordpress blog
                        site we built in my first web programming class. After having done this site, I'd like to go
                        back to Wordpress and see what I can improve on. Conversley, having built this from the ground 
                        up, going back to Wordpress will probably frustrate the hell out of me.
